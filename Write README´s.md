 ## **Who Is Your Documentation For?**

#### Documentation is for:
- **Future YOU.**
- **Co-workers, or Contributers.**
- **End User.**
_Therefore, Documentations should be **clear, descriptive and easy to follow**._

## **Anatomy Of A README**

1. **Title & Description.**
   - a sentece or two may be enough but be sure to provide clear explanation.
   
2. **Information for undersanding your code/project.**
   This may include:
   - _Installation instructions._
   - _Dependencies on other libraries, frameworks._
   - _Usage._
   - _Known bugs._
   - _Issues._
   - _Examples._
   
3. **License.**  

## **Markdown**
- a light markup language often used for READMEs (though you'll find other use cases for it, too!). 
- Here is [Markdown documentaion](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/).

## **HTML**
You can still use HTML in markdown when you could not accomplish something using markdown.

## **Dillinger**
- Markdown files use **.md** extension. It needs to be opened by specific software like [**Dillinger**](https://dillinger.io/).
- You can also open it in your text editors using some plugin or extension.
- For VS Code you can install [Markdown All In One extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one).
