In JavaScript, an object is an unordered collection of properties. 
Each property consists of a key/value pair, 
and can reference either 
- a primitive (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans, etc.) 
- or another object. 
Unlike elements in an array[], which are accessed by a numeric index, 
properties in objects are accessed by their key name using either {}square bracket notation or . dot notation.
