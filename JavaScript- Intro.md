### a. What is JavaScript?
- __HTML__ and __CSS__ are `markup languages`, that _describe and define elements within a document_. 
- __JavaScript__ is a `programming language`, used to _communicate instructions to a machine_ to:
    1) _control the behavior of a machine_ 
    2) _express algorithms_.

### b. The JavaScript Console
The __JavaScript Console__ is a development tools to debug JavaScript directly into the web browser.
```
"Diana"
alert("Hello "Diana"! How are you?!");
```
This creates a _JavaScript alert box_ in the web browser, on the current web page.
