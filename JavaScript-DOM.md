###THE DOM: What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?
- The DOM stands for `"Document Object Model"` 
- The document object is provided by the browser
- It is a representation of the HTML document. 
- It is:
1) a __tree-like structure__, 
2) a representation of the HTML document, 
3) the relationship between elements, 
4) and contains the content and properties of the elements.
- __NOTE:__The DOM is __NOT__: part of the JavaScript language.
- __ECMAScript__ is the language specification JavaScript is based on. It __ONLY__ references the _document object model in one place_, in its "Global Object" section:

The DOM is:
- constructed from the browser
- globally accessible by JavaScript code using the document object
- used all of the time 

### Create the DOM: How the DOM gets created? 
- When you request a website, it responds with HTML: 
- These bytes recieved are run through a `parsing process` 
- ===> it determine characters (eg., start tag character, atribute) 
- ===> it is a tokenizer 
- ===> it shows its tokens (DOCTYPE, start tag, end tag, comments) 
- ===> it convert into the DOM (a tree structure, that captures HTML content and properties and relationships between the nodes)

So to reiterate the process, it's:
- `characters`
- `tags`
- `tokens`
- `nodes`
- `DOM`


### Access the DOM: How to access the DOM with JavaScript?
_ There are various ways to access the DOM with JavaScript:

1) SELECT AN ELEMENT BY ID
```
document.getElementById();
```
If we ran the code above in the console, we wouldn't get anything, because we did not tell it the ID of any element to get! We need to pass a string to .getElementById() of the ID of the element that we want it to find and subsequently return to us:
``` 
document.getElementById('footer');
```

2) SELECT MULTIPLE ELEMENTS 
The next two DOM methods that we'll be looking at that both return multiple elements are:
`.getElementsByClassName()`
`.getElementsByTagName()`

Accessing Elements By Their Tag
After looking at both .getElementById() and .getElementsByClassName(), the new .getElementsByTagName() method should seem quite easy on the eyes:

```
document.getElementsByTagName('p');
```
There are a few important things to keep in mind about these two methods:
1) both methods use the document object
2) both return multiple items
3) the list that's returned is not an array

Node
A Node acts like a blueprint containing all the data (properties) and the functionality (methods). This is called an interface. Based on the interface we know the properties and methods that are going to be applied to the individual items, which we call nodes.

ELEMENT INTERFACE
The element interface inherits all properties AND methods from the Node. It is a descendent iself of the node, as well as its elements.
