The __array__ `[]` = an `ordered collection of elements, enclosed by square brackets (i.e., [ and ]).`
It is one of the most useful data structures in JavaScript. 
__Example:__  Here's a variable called myArray, which is assigned to an empty array:
```
const myArray = [];
```

Each element in an array is referenced by a numeric key called an index, which starts from zero and increments by one for each additional element in the array. 
Example:

const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape', 'lychee'];

console.log(fruits);
// ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape', `lychee`]
If we want to retrieve the first (left-most) element in fruits, we access that element by its index:

fruits[0];

// 'apple'
Likewise, this is how we can access the last (right-most) element in fruits:

fruits[4];

// 'lychee'
