   ## What makes React Special?
  The fundamentals of React are:
  1) its componential nature.
  2) the way data flows to a component.
  3) React is just JavaScript.   
  
   ## What is Composition?
  `Composition`= to combine simple functions to build more complicated ones.
  
  ### Benefits of Composition
 __How we can build up complex functions by combining simple ones together?__

  `composition`= __built from simple functions!__

  Example:
  getProfileLink() function with composition:
  ```
function getProfileLink (username) {
  return 'https://github.com/' + username
}
```
getProfilePic function:
```
function getProfilePic (username) {
  return 'https://github.com/' + username + '.png?size=200'
}
```
### COMPOSITION 
- To compose these simple functions, just combine them together into another function:
```
function getProfileData (username) {
  return {
    pic: getProfilePic(username),
    link: getProfileLink(username)
  }
}
```
Example:
getProfileData()function without composition:
(provide the data directly)
```
function getProfileData (username) {
  return {
    pic: 'https://github.com/' + username + '.png?size=200',
    link: 'https://github.com/' + username
  }
}
```
__NOTE__: This is accurate JavaScript code. But this isn't composition. 

Potential issues with this version that isn't using composition. If the user's link to GitHub is needed somewhere else, then duplicate code would be needed. A good function should follow the "DOT" rule:

`Do One Thing`

This function is doing a couple of different (however minor) things; it's creating two different URLs, storing them as properties on an object, and then returning that object. In the composed version, each function just does one thing:

- getProfileLink = builds a string of user's GitHub profile link
- getProfilePic = builds a string the user's GitHub profile picture
- getProfileData â€“ returns a new object

### React & Composition
React makes use of the power of composition, heavily! React builds up pieces of a UI using components. Let's take a look at some pseudo code for an example. Here are three different components:
```
<Page/>
<Article/>
<Sidebar/>
```
Now let's take these simple components, combine them together, and create a more complex component (aka, composition in action!):
```
<Page>
  <Article/>
  <Sidebar/>
</Page>
```
Now the Page component has the Article and Sidebar components inside. This is just like the earlier example where getProfileData had getProfileLink and getProfilePic inside it.

__NOTE__: Composition plays a huge part in building React components.

### Composition Recap
Composition occurs when simple functions are combined together to create more complex functions. Think of each function as a single building block that does one thing (DOT). When you combine these simple functions together to form a more complex function, this is composition.
