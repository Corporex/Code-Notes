## 1. A11y Overview
__GOALS:__
- a. __Accessibility__: What is accessibility?
- b. __User experience:__ Explore diversity of user experience with web and apps.
- c. __Screen readers:__ How to use screen readers practically?
- d. __Inclusive webexperiences:__ How to build webexperiences for all users?

### a. __DEFINITION__: What is accessibility?
- `Good accessibility`("a11y"):`_to ensure all users can access the content in web and apps_`.
- Site _**content**_ needs to be `available` to everyone.
- Site _**functionality**_ needs to be `operable` to everyone.
__`Acessibility`__= to make sure "content" and "websites" created are `usable` to people with _various imparements or abilities._
- __Note:__ 
- `"a11y"` is a shorten word for `"accessibility"`(=there's 11 letters between the "A" and "Y" in the word "Accessibility"). 
- `"i18n"`is a shorten word for `"internationalization"`.
- `" l10n"`is a shorten word for `"localization"`.

### b. __USER EXPERIENCE:__ _Explore diversity of user experience with web and apps_
- Consider accessibility (`"a11y"`) from the start of your process, as it `affects all users`:

1) __Users with `_disabilities_`:__ (issues due to `human disability`.) 
- a. `Vision impairment`
  - __vision disability:__ (_blind or have significant difficulty seeing even with glasses_)
  - __refractive error:__ (_a visual impairment which may be corrected with glasses if mild enough_)
  - __color vision deficiency:__(_difficulty to distinguish colors_)
- b. `Hearing impairment`  
  - __hearing disability:__(_deaf or have significant difficulty hearing even with hearing devices_)
- c. `Cognitive impairment`
  - __cognitive disability:__ (_difficulty remembering, concentrating, or making decisions_)
- d. `Motor impairment`
  - __physical disability:__ (_part of the body does not work optimal_)
- __Note:__ These impairments can be `Temporary`, `Permanent`, or `Situational`.)  

2) __Users `_without disabilities_`:__ (issues due to `bad design`) 
- __unresponsive design__ 
- __lack of__ `color contrast` 
- __lack of__ `keyboard navigation`
- __lack of__ `visual or sound alternative`
- __lack of__ `zoom-in option`
- __lack of__ `minimal design`(_to minimize distraction_)

### c. SCREEN READERS/VIEWERS 
A __Screen viewer__ = `software that allows blind people to hear the information displayed on a screen, via text-to-speach-syntiziser.`

- __How to use a Screenreader?__
- Enable `ChromeVox Lite` via the "Enable ChromeVox Lite" button or press `TAB` once.
- The controls for ChromeVox Lite will appear once it is enabled:
- `"Voice"` drop-down: to choose alternate voices
- `"Speech rate"` drop-down: to make speech faster or slower
- `"Navigate"`buttons: to move ChromeVox's focus to non-focusable items on the page (e.g. Headers)
- `"Volume control"`: to fine-tune ChromeVox's volume.

### d. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines: 
_Web Content Accessibility Guidelines_ make your website and app 
- __"POUR"__ (4 core principles):
- `Percievable`: to make sure ALL users can "percieve" content. (_Is the content "visual, audio, text, keyboard, touch!- ready?_)
- `Operable`: to make sure users can "work" with the content. (_Can users use your components and navigate the content?_) 
- `Understandable`: to make sure users "understand" the content & the interface. (_Can users understand your content?_) 
- `Robust`: to make sure ALL users (_Is the content "robust" enought be be consumed by a wide variety of ages?_)
- __Note:__ Although the below guidelines are a great resource, what actually matters is `"the users experience"`.

## 2. FOCUS
__GOALS:__
- a. __FOCUS (MANAGEMENT):__ What is focus (management)? 
- b. __DOMANAGEMENT:__ What is focus? 
- c. __TABINDEX ATTRIBUTE__ 
- d. __SKIP LINKS__ 
- e. __MANAGE FOCUS AT COMPONENT LEVEL__ 
- f. __  :__ ?

### a. __DEFINITION__:  focus (management)
__FOCUS__= `the location on a page that receives input from the keyboard`. It shows _where keyboard events go in a page_.
- An __HTML user interface(UI)__ consists of _multiple interactive widgets_ (__input__, __buttons__ & __select__ elements), 
- Such as:`form controls`, `scrollable regions`, `links`, `dialog boxes`, `browser tabs`, that form a `hierarchy` of `automatic tab order + built-in keyboard event handling`. They are __implicitely focussable__.
- Yet, __NOT all elements are focussable__. Examples are `header`, `paragraphs`and `images`. 

__FOCUS MANAGEMENT__= Move focus around the page using your [keyboard](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html#focus-management) to interact with the interface.
- __TAB ORDER__:  _key input_ is channeled from the system, through a hierarchy of interactive widgets, to the "active(= focused) widget:
- ```TAB```: move focus forward
- ```SHIFT  TAB```: move focus backwards
- ```Arrow keys```: to navigate inside a component
```
Don't add focus to any content a user can Not interact with.
```
#### Sources:
- [Focus Management](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html#focus-management)
- Exception: [add focus to non-interactionable content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=155&v=ifW_oy9hajU)

### b. DOM ORDER
The DOM order matters for FOCUS MANAGEMENT: `element.tabIndex;`
```
Tab order = same as DOM order, even if  `visual` order is changed (with CSS).
Changing the  `visual` order can cause confusion among `screen readers` and `keyboard users`, who depend on keyboard navigation. 
```
- Work with native elements is good practice for __FOCUS behaviour__, because they are automatically be inserted into the __TAB ORDER__, based on their __DOM POSITION__.
```
<button> I should </button>
<button> Be Focussed </button>
<button> Last! </button>
```
#### Sources: 
- [WebAIM checklist items](http://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist#sc1.3.2)

### c. TABINDEX ATTRIBUTE
To get tabindex value of an element: `element.tabIndex;`

##### 1) __tabindex = "-1"__
_ [.] __NOT__ in tab order.
- [.] focus programmatically by `focus()`
- [.] Used for __Off screen content, that appear in response to a user event()__ (ex. modals).
```
<dialog id="modal" tabindex="-1"></dialog>
```
##### 2) __tabindex = "0"__
- [.] to insert __Unfocusable element__ in tab order.
- [.] focus programmatically by `focus()`
- [.] So, `keyboard events` get directed to it.
```
<div id="dropdown" tabindex="0"></div>
```
##### 3) __tabindex > 0__
[.] __IN__ (front of) tab order.
[.] If multiple elements, `lowest value`= first (in tab order).

### d. SKIP LINKS
- Allow `screen reader, keyboard, and switch devices users` to __navigate__ towards main pagecontent.
- Skip links makes all links __hidden until focus().__
- It bypasses all navigation items and other elements before main content.
```
<!--html code-->
<a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>
<nav>
.
.
</nav>
<main id="main-content" tabindex="-1">
.
.
</main>
```
```
/*CSS code*/
.skip-link {
  position: absolute;
  top: -40px;
  left: 0;
  background: red;
  color: white;
  padding: 8px;
  z-index: 100;
  }
.skip-link:focus {
  top: 0;
  }
  ```
#### Sources: **[Alternate way to skip to main content.](https://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/#headings)**

### d. MANAGE FOCUS AT COMPONENT LEVEL
 - Like in case of drop down menu, tree view component. The keyboard interaction after getting focused is what we are talking about.
 - [WAI-Aria guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/) provide guidance in selcting which keyboard interaction is appropriate for such action.
 
### e. ROVING FOCUS
- To implement focus inside of a component.
- For example: Radio group:
  - first radio button: 1. tabindex="0" / 2. checked / 3. focus()
  - when moving to the next element => first element: 1. tabindex="-1" / 2. remove checked / 3. unfocus :: next element: 1. tabindex="0" / 2. checked / 3. focus()
  - If it is the last element `tab` move us to the first element.
  - If it is the first element `shift` + `tab` move us to the last element.
    - [Example](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/radio/radio-1/radio-1.html)
  - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCIC2LNt0bk)

### f. Off-screen Content
- Like drawer panel.
- This can lead focus to visually disappear.
- You can track the focus (active element) by `document.activeElement;`
- Overcome it by setting `display: none;` or `visibility: hidden;`

### g. Keyboard Trap
- [WebAim](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist#sc2.1.2)
- It is desirable in modals when you want to trap keyboard focus inside the modal until you close it => return focus to the last focused element before modal open.
- [Example](https://github.com/udacity/ud891/tree/gh-pages/lesson2-focus/07-modals-and-keyboard-traps)




## 3. Semantics Basics

### a. Affordances
- Definition: the qualities or properties of an object that define its possible uses or make clear how it can or should be used.
- [WebAim](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html)
- Screen reader can provide info for elements' **Name(label) Role State Value.**
- Browser takes DOM tree (natively semantic elements or othered with ARIA)  ==modify it to==> Accessibility tree( containing all information for screen reader Name Role State Value).

### b. Labeling, Naming, and Alternative text
- [WebAim](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist#g1.1)
- Element could have a visual label (name) like for radio button or text alternative like in case of images.
- There are 2 ways of labeling form inputs.
```
<label>
  <input type="radio">
  Check me
</label>
```
```
<input type="radio" id="radio-button">
<label for="radio-button">Check me</label>
```
 - Using these labeling allow user to toggle the input element by also clicking the label.
 - alt text: 1. An alternative to the image if not loaded.
             2. describe what the image about for screen reader.
             3. For logos you can assign the company name for alt attribute.
             4. For search icon you can leave alt with no value. This will skip it from accessibility tree.
             5. Any image that is meant for decoration should have an empty alt.
             
             
## 4. Navigating Content
- Screen Reader can make you navigate through headings, links, form controls, and landmarks.
- It is important to use meaningful headings and links names.
- Also use a good heading structure from h1 to h6 (for long complex content).
- descriptive link text example: 
instead of using "learn more" links text use :learn more about bla bla".
- [link Anti-patterns video](https://youtu.be/SiblO4dfYBg)
- Landmarks: you can navigate by landmarks
`<header>`
`<nav>`
`<main>`
`<section>`
`<article>`
`<aside>`
`<footer>`

## 5. ARIA
- **WAI-ARIA**: Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Application.
- ARIA attributes need to have explicit values (can't be empty values).

- What ARIA can do and what can not do:
  - Can:
  
  :white_check_mark: modify Accessibility tree.
  
  - Can Not:
  
  :x: modify element behaviour.
  
  :x: modify element appearance.
  
  :x: add focus.
  
  :x: add event handling.
  
- ARIA give a semantic meaning to non semantic elements.
- ARIA can also give a new semantic meaning to a native semantic element.
  - Example:
  ```
  <button role="switch" aria-checked="true" class="toggle">
    Enable
  </button>
  ```
- ARIA can express UI patterns which doesn't exist in HTML.
  - Example: `tree widget`

- ARIA can add labels which is only accessible to assestive technology.

- ARIA can provide semantic Relationship.

- ARIA can provide live updates (aria-live).

- the [video](https://youtu.be/7vz1aakYHtw?t=50s) explains that.

### a. Role

- Definition: Short hand for a particular UI pattern.

- make sure that the role attribute is in the same element as tabindex attribute.

```
<div tabindex="0" role="checkbox" aria-checked="true" class="checkbox" checked>check me</div>
```

### b. ARIA labelling

- **aria-label** _attribute_
  - Can be used for element that has only a visual appearance.
  - override any other labelling such as `<label>`, or text content (like that for a button) except **aria-labelledby** _attribute_.
  - have the label clicking behaviour like `<label>` 
  
- **aria-labelledby** _attribute_
  - Overcome all other labelling methods.
  - refers to another element (which label it) by using a value corresponds to the id of the labelling element.
  - can take more than one element id (multiple labels) .
  - can refer to elements that are hidden for assestive technologies ( hidden for example).
  - Don't have the label clicking behaviour like `<label>` and `aria-label`.
  
### c. Landmarks and ARIA roles
- Landmarks may not have support in browsers' old versions. So we need to use role attribute with them.
  -Examples: 
  ```
  <header role="banner">
  <nav role="navigation">
  <main role="main">
  <aside role="complementary">
  <footer role="contentinfo">
  <dialog role="dialog">
  ```
  
### d. ARIA realtionships  
- **ARIA relationship attributes**
  - They take a reference to one or more elements on the page to make a link between them.
  - The difference is: 1. _What link means_.
                       2. _How represented to users_.
          
- Attributes: 
  - `aria-labelledby`
  - `aria-describedby`
  - `aria-owns`
  - `aria-activedescendant`
  - `aria-posinset`
  - `aria-setsize`
    
- [Video](https://youtu.be/e1ZmfmnB6v8?t=40s) explains it.
- [Collection of relationship attr](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#attrs_relationships)


### e. Visible and Hidden content
- For the seek of fine tuning the experience of users using assistive tech.
- To ensure that certain parts of the DOM is either: 
  - hidden to assistive tech.
  Or
  - Only visible to assistive tech.
- Hidden:

  1. 
  ```
  <button style="visibility: hidden;">
  <div style="display: none;">
  <span hidden>
  ```
  2. `aria-hidden="true"`
  
- Only visible to assistive tech:
  1. element positioned absolute far off the screen. `position: absolute; left: -1000;`
  2. `aria-label`
  3. `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby` reference a hidden element.


### f. ARIA live
- for in time alerts to user.
- `aria-live="polite"`  : important but not urgent alert.
- `aria-live="assertive"` : important and urgent alert.

### g. ARIA relevant
- These attributes work with `aria-live`:

  - `aria-atomic` : when true assistive tech will present the entire region as a whole.
  - `aria-relevant` :indicates which type of changes should be presented to the user.
    `aria-relevant="additions"` ==> means any element added to live region is presented.
    `aria-relevant="text"` ==> means that any text content added to any descendant element is presented.
    `aria-relevant="removals"` ==> means that removal of any text or element within the live region is presented.
    `aria-relevant="all"` ==> means that additions or removals of text is presented.
    `aria-relevant="additions text"` (default).
  -  `aria-busy`
 
## 6. Style
### a. Focus style
- [WebAim](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist#sc2.4.7).
- [video shows different styling for focus using :focus pseudo selector](https://youtu.be/ZooEnrj8aMc).
- [video shows different styling reaction between native and non native buttons](https://youtu.be/bfPGicTGBTI).
- Styling with ARIA ==> using ARIA attribute as an attribute selector. This made a good verification that I set the aria state properly.
- Responsive website:
  - [WebAim](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist#sc1.4.4).
  - meta viewport tag: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`
  - In meta viewport tag: don't use `user-scalable=no` ==> prevent user from zooming the screen.
  - Use relative CSS units.
  - Use appropriate size touch targets.Minimum touch target size is 48 px.
  - If the touch target(like icons) is smaller, add padding to it.
  - To avoid overlapping make sure to leave margin around touch target with minimum 32px.
- Color Contrast:
  - [WebAim Minimum](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist#sc1.4.3).
  -It states that: Body text (less than 18.66px) ==> Contrast ratio minimum `4.5:1`
                   Large Text (more than 18.66px) or (24px) ==> Contrast ratio minimum `3:1`
                   
  - [WebAim Enhanced](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist#sc1.4.6).
   -It states that: Body text (less than 18.66px) ==> Contrast ratio minimum `7:1`
                    Large Text (more than 18.66px) or (24px) ==> Contrast ratio minimum `4.5:1`
 - You can use {Chrome Accessibility Extension}(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-developer-t/fpkknkljclfencbdbgkenhalefipecmb?hl=en) to make Accessibility Audit to check contrast ratios and see recommendations and try them live at Dev tools.
- 1 of 20 men and 1 in 200 women suffer from some sort of color blindness.
  - Don't convey info with color alone.
  - You can use color together with text, underline, audio, and aria-live.
  - [WebAim](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist#sc1.4.1).
  - You can use [Nocoffee chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nocoffee/jjeeggmbnhckmgdhmgdckeigabjfbddl?hl=en-US) to experience color blindness vision and enhance use of color to convey info.
  - Use [High Contrast chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/high-contrast/djcfdncoelnlbldjfhinnjlhdjlikmph?hl=en) and check how your UI appear for high contrast users.
