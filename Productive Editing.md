## TEST: Productive Editing (Lesson 15)

Use keyboard shortcuts and code editor extensions to 
- speed up your development process
- help to avoid repetitive typing tasks

### TEXT EDITOR
In the first couple of days of using a new editor, try out lots of build-in shortcuts and features, even if they seem overkill. 
- Try them all out and observe yourself. 
- Which shortcuts stick?
- Which do you have to force yourself to use?

### Extending your Editor
- Open the Sublime console with View -> Show Console or Ctrl + `
- _[Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/)_: The Sublime Text package manager
- _[Emmet](https://emmet.io/)_ home page
